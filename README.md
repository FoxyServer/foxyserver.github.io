Foxy Server gives you access to the world's library of software **without downloading anything**. Whenever your local machine cannot resolve a command, it gets escalated to the Foxy Server where we execute it using the current packages in our stash.

<br>
##Inspiration
Every software developer has struggled with software downloads. Whether it is a difficult to configure install process or a slow internet connection, it can kill productivity. You want to iterate as quickly as possible, and this tool allows you to do just that.

<br>
## Execution
```foxy``` is the terminal command which allows resolution. If you local machine cannot resolve your command, Foxy saves the day. If the package you request cannot be resolved from our Library, you are sent home empty-handed.

## What's Next?
We have a small amount of grant funding which we are putting to hard work creating an MVP to test. We are looking for beta-testers always, so stay in touch at [foxyserver.com](foxyserver.com).
